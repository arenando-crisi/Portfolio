        This project was born within the editorial framework of the DesignVerso
        project, a publication which, through articles and interviews, aims to
        reconstruct the figure of important communication designers.<br />
        In particular, this is dedicated to AG Fronzoni, an important Tuscan
        designer who often and willingly worked in Milan collaborating with
        major institutions and artists such as Lucio Fontana.<br />
        The elements of Fronzoni's style have been recalled on the cover and in
        the textual inserts, such as black and white, the text inclination and
        the sans serif typography. The project brief also required an insert
        that could be interactive and linked to the work of the designer, here
        it is a magnetic board to which you can attach magnetic characters to
        compose a poster, similarly to how Fronzoni made up his own.<br />
        Lastly, the bookmark takes up the poster designed for the Lucio Fontana
        exhibition, perhaps one of the most important works by AG Fronzoni.<br />
